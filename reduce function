reduce() function accepts a function and a sequence and returns a single value calculated as follows:

1. Initially, the function is called with the first two items from the sequence and the result is returned.
2 . The function is then called again with the result obtained in step 1 and the next value in the sequence. 
This process keeps repeating until there are items in the sequence.


def do_sum(x1,x2):
   return x1+x2

mylist=[1,2,3,4]

print reduce(do_sum,mylist)



def do_sum(x1, x2): 
    return x1 + x2

def my_reduce(func, seq):
    first = seq[0]
    
    for i in seq[1:]:
        
        first = func(first, i)
        
        
    return first

print(my_reduce(do_sum, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
